      <description>R=Studio? &amp;amp; Python=Snakes? These two languages are very interesting--
As we have previously learned in SDS 348, R and Python have some differences.
For instance, R syntax is fat (sorry buddy) and python syntax looks soooo clean! Both hey they are both still kinda confusing but SO fun to learn!
For the majority of this semester, we have explored the R Studio world.
Here is R Studio at work: library(reticulate) hehe &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;good, how are you, buddy?</description>
