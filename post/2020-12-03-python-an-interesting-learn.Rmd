## R=Studio? & Python=Snakes? 

These two languages are very interesting-- 

As we have previously learned in SDS 348, R and Python have some differences. 

For instance, R syntax is fat (sorry buddy) and python syntax looks soooo clean! Both hey they are both still kinda confusing but SO fun to learn! 

For the majority of this semester, we have explored the R Studio world.

Here is R Studio at work:

```{r}

library(reticulate)

hehe <- "good, how are you, buddy?"
hehe
```



For the ending of this semester, we have explored the Python world. 

Here is Python at work:

```{python}
x="hi how are you?"
print(x)
y="good and you?"
print(y)
z = "you're silly"
print(z)

print(x,r.hehe)

```

## It is pretty neat how these two languages can talk to each other! 


Now let's use python to do some cool things!!

sorry I love corgis :)

```{python}
import re
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

string1="corgi"
string2="corgy"

re.findall(r"corg[iy]",string1)
re.findall(r"corg[iy]",string2)

```
